Convert your mirror into your personal assistant.


A smart mirror is a two-way mirror with an electronic display behind the glass. The display can show the viewer different kinds of 
information in the form of widgets, such as weather, time, date, and news updates. This product would be useful for busy individuals 
that want to multitask and stay informed while on the go. Instead of constantly pulling out a device, one could get informed while 
finishing daily grooming tasks. I designed and built my own prototype and delved into the world of do-it-yourself smart mirrors. 
Some of the modules include: 
1) Google Calendar 
2) To-do list 
3) Weather forecast 
4) Air Pollution Index 
5) Latest News Headlines 
All these are customised to each person that comes in front of the mirror, based on the through a facial recognition system that 
has been implemented using openCV and Python. A PIR sensor is also included to turn the mirror off when no one is present to save
power. The Smart Mirror is a home accessory that brings more utility to a simple everyday object. The objective of the mirror is to
help make everyday life more efficient and possibly even reduce the clutter of other devices and screen around the house,
giving the house a very futuristic and utilitarian feel.
